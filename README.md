# Heart-disease-detection-Machine-Learning
The project is aimed at detecting heart disease condition from dataset collected from different individuals. For clarity, "0 & 1" were used to denote the absence and presence of heart disease respectively in the individual samples.
Different machine learning techniques were employed using Python programming language libraries.
For the purpose of visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used to implement Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Feature Engineering techniques of One-Hot-Encoding, Simple Imputation and Normalization(StandardScaler) were applied.
Machine learning algorithms viz; XGBoost, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine were used in developing 3 different predictive models that yielded accuracies of
XGBoost: 88%
Random Forest: 89%
Support Vector Machine: 88%
Dataset was sourced from Kaggle.com
